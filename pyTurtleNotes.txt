- Turning and Forward movement cannot be simultaneous.

  - Should it just turn clockwise or counterclockwise
    until the user prompts to move forward or backward again?
    Or just move a small angle clockwise or counterclockwise, 
    and then keep moving forward (current setting, it's nearly simultaneous)


- Ray...

   - Moving forward and drawing a ray cannot be simultaneous, 
     so a continuous ray cannot exist.

   - Can draw a ray for a split second when the angle is turned, 
     so that we can see the robot's new direction, and then the 
     robot can keep moving forward after the ray has disappeared.

   - Should it be kept in? It slows it down a little, but it helps to see the direction
     that the robot is moving in (we could always just set the robot to be an arrow though...)



- Obstacles:

  - Should I make the preset maps? Or should I try to make a way that the obstacles can be drawn in 
    with mouseclicks before the user starts the robot moving?
    The latter would be quite a bit more complicated, but...better?



- Should the robot leave a trail, as it currently does?



- Should I try to use states, like in previous version??
  I currently have a few boolean global variables like "running1", "running2",
  and "running3", which, depending on whether they are true or false, will
  determine whether the robot is moving forward, backward, or autonomously
  (respectively).
