changes to original game:
-added timed appearance of random food, and timed disappearance of oldest food
-added reverse function (activated by pressing 's')
-added breadth-first search autonomous mode 
 (activated by pressing 'a', cancelled by pressing one of the arrow keys)


functions added:
-reverse(): Reverses the snake, and moves it in the opposite direction.

-removeFoodItem(): Removes the oldest food item on the screen.

-isBody(point): Returns true if the inputted point is in the snake's body, 
                returns false otherwise.

-hasFoundNom(): If the snake has just made contact with food, 
                this function returns true and the index of the newly eaten food
                in the array containing the food items, returns false and 0 otherwise.

-isVisited(point): Used in multiBFS. Returns true if the inputted point 
                   has already been visited/checked in the current breadth-first search, 
                   returns false otherwise.

-isPath(point): Used in multiBFS. Returns true if the inputted point
                is a part of the direct path discovered by the current breadth-first search, 
                returns false otherwise.

-isNom(point): Used in multiBFS. Returns true if the inputted point is food, 
               returns false otherwise.

-isBorder(point): Used in multiBFS. Returns true if the inputted point is on or beyond the border, 
                  returns false otherwise.

-isOpen(point): Used in multiBFS. Returns true if the inputted point is not on the border and 
                not in the snake's Body, or if the inputted point is food. Returns false otherwise.

-multiBFS(): Searches for the quickest path from the snake's head to the nearest food item, 
             and returns the next direction the snake must turn to in order to follow the path,
             in the form of a direction string 
             ('up', 'down', 'left', 'right', or null if there is no path).

-auto(): Makes the snake move autonomously using breadth-first search. 
         If the snake gets trapped by its own body, it will reverse to keep moving. 
         If the snake is still stuck after reversing, the game will declare that the game is over.


Known issue(s):
-game cannot be reset by pressing the "Restart" button 
 (found by pressing "Pause", or by losing the game) if autonomous mode has been activated
 at any time during the game. Instead, the user must refresh his or her browser window.
